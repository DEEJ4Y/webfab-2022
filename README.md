# Disqualified üò¢

I was disqualified from this hackathon. Apparently using Mantine was not allowed, but they didn't specify anything before the hackathon. Below is a screenshot of the rules provided to us:

![WebFab 2022 rules](./public/webfab-2022-rules.jpeg)

Apparently Mantine comes under

> premade website templates

They even said Bootstrap comes under premade website templates.

I completely disagree with this, Mantine/Bootstrap and other component libraries do not count as premade website templates. There is a huge difference between piecing together styled components in the way you want and just editing a prebuilt template.

I built this website by myself from scratch. Unfortunately, the rules weren't clear enough.

If the rules were specified clearly before, I would have built the website using custom CSS.

Waste of my time. Never going to attend any of their events ever again.

## Updating data

All the team members and activities data is stored in the `üìÅassets/` folder.

### Team members `üìÅassets/team.js`

Each team member has an object of the follwing shape:

```js
{
  name: "",             // Name of the member
  imgUrl: "",           // URL for the member's image
  department: "",       // Department/Domain of the member
  role: "",             // Member's position in the association
  bio: "",              // Bio of the member
  linkedin: "",         // URL for the member's Linkedin page
  personalWebsite: "",  // Personal URL that a member wants to share
  github: "",           // Github profile of the member
  group: "",            // Optional. Group that the member belongs to in the organizational heirarchy.
},
```

The team object has the following shape:

```js
const team = {
  facultyHeads: [
    // team member object 1
    // team member object 2
    // ...
  ],
  boardMembers: [
    // ...
  ],

};
```
